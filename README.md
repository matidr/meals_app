A Flutter app for browsing, filtering, and favoriting meals! This project helps reinforce key Flutter concepts such as navigation stacks, tab bars, and navigation drawers. It's part of a learning journey to deepen skills in Flutter development.

## 📖 What I Learnt

This app served as a practical implementation of several Flutter navigation techniques:

- `Navigator` API for managing screen stacks
- Tab-based navigation using `BottomNavigationBar`
- `Drawer` widget integration for additional screens or filters
- Stateful vs Stateless widgets
- Passing data between screens
- Basic UI layout and widget composition
